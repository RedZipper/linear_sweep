This is an IA-32 disassembler; currently the disassembler only supports a 
sub-set of the Intel instruction set. It parses a binary using the linear sweep algorithm. 
View the LinearSweep class to see the supported instructions. There are a couple a bugs that need
to be worked out when disassembling some MOV instructions.
